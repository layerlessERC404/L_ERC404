Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Compile

```

### Coverage

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/DeployFoo.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545

For this script to work, you need to have a `MNEMONIC` environment variable set to a valid
[BIP39 mnemonic](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).
